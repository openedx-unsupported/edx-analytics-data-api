            For example, edX/DemoX/Demo_Course.
        page -- The page of results that should be returned.
        page_size -- The maximum number of results to return per page.
        text_search -- An alphanumeric string that is used to search name,
            username, and email address values to find learners.
        segments -- A comma-separated list of segment names that is used
            to select learners. Only learners who are categorized in at least
            one of the segments are returned. Cannot be used in combination
            with the `ignore_segments` argument.
        ignore_segments -- A comma-separated list of segment names that is
            used to exclude learners. Only learners who are NOT categorized
            in any of the segments are returned. Cannot be used in combination
            with the `segments` argument.
        cohort -- The cohort to which all returned learners must
            belong.
        enrollment_mode -- The learning track to which all returned
            learners must belong.
