edX Data Analytics API Overview
################################

The edX Data Analytics API provides the tools for building applications to view
and analyze student activity in your course.

The edX Platform APIs use REST design principles and support the JSON 
data-interchange format.

****************************************
edX Data Analytics API Version 0, Alpha
****************************************

The edX Data Analytics API is currently at version 0 and is an Alpha release.
We plan on making significant enhancements and changes to the API.

The Data Analytics API uses key-based authentication and currently has no
built-in authorization mechanism. Therefore third parties cannot currently use
the Data Analytics API with edx.org data.

Open edX users can use the Data Analytics API with their own instances.

EdX plans to make the Data Analytics API available to partners in the future,
and invites feedback.
